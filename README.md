# Linux A-TEAM MCA CyberPatriot scripts
This repo is a few scripts used to help automate some of the more 
tedious processes in the Linux/Ubuntu CyberPatriot State Competition.
All of them were tested on ***MacOS*** and ***Manjaro/Arch Linux***. Updates on 
their functionality will come after they have been used.

These are a collection of scripts that have come from previous vulnerabilities,
like TCP SYNcookies, and other documented vulnerabilities and modifications
that people have made over time. These scripts will probably be updated, as
more of these competitions occur.

This code was arranged by atomtables and swaroop.
